# Mini-Project-
The goal-line technology is a method used to determine when the ball has slightly crossed 
the goal line with the assistance of electronic devices 
and at the same time assisting the referee in awarding a goal or not. 
Aim of goal- line technology is to assist the match officials in decision-making rather than replacing them.

Project Undertaken
The project undertaken is 'GOAL LINE TECHNOLOGY', based on embedded systems.
This project aims at detecting goal with the help of IR sensor . For the purpose of display, (PIC 18F2420) microcontroller is used.
